Hello! My name is Sylwia Zaro≈õlak.

I learn something new about testing every day. I have no commercial experience, so  I am especially open to collaboration in the form of an internship.
Why did I decide to test? I enjoy planning and I pay attention to the details. 

My idea of testing is the same as sudoku, which I adore! There is a chance of making a mistake while entering any number. Success is achieved if we enter the number accurately. We have made progress on resolving the riddle. If not, will I be able to go back and find the place where I made a mistake? I may have to start the whole process from the beginning. So, testing for me entails both seeking out the correct answers as well as those that lead me to the incorrect solution. Nobody is perfect.

Important! My job is more than just using a computer. It's first and foremost the people you interact with and encourage one another.
The dream team? I'm in!

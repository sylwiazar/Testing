## About me

Hello! My name is Sylwia ZaroÅ›lak.

I learn something new about testing every day. I have no commercial experience, so  I am especially open to collaboration in the form of an internship.
Why did I decide to test? I enjoy planning and I pay attention to the details. 

## My test case example:
